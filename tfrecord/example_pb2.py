# tfrecord/example_pb2.py
"""
A compatibility thin-wrapper that

1.  **Prefers TensorFlowâ€™s own proto definitions** (they are already in the
    processâ€™ address-space if the user imported TensorFlow / Keras /
    ðŸ¤— Transformers, and therefore cannot be re-declared).

2.  Falls back to the generated file that ships with *tfrecord* whenever
    TensorFlow is absent (e.g. in very light-weight, CPU-only environments).

It exports exactly the symbols that the original generated file contained,
so the rest of the *tfrecord* codebase â€” and your application code â€” do not
have to change at all.
